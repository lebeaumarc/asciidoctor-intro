= Which editor should I use ?

There are now many editors which support asciidoc either as a plugin, or as their main targetted document type.

You can find a partial list here : http://asciidoctor.org/docs/editing-asciidoc-with-live-preview/

None of them is perfect. Sometimes some diagrams are not rendered, some don't allow "undo/redo", ... You'll have to decide yourself which one suits best your purpose.

My preference currently goes to Microsoft Visual Studio Code. 

But the important thing is : all of them allow you to fluently put your ideas on paper, and only take some time later to refine them and structure them in such a way that you'll be able to re-use them.

So far, none of them included an automated PDF rendering worth mentioning. That's why I keep my little ruby scripts at hand.
